IT APPLIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH CLAIMS ARE BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTE, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, MISREPRESENTATION OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY.

and (ii) claims related to or arising from any alleged unauthorized use, piracy or theft.
This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you.
An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury.
Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery.
It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND VALVE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.
You and Valve agree to make reasonable, good faith efforts to informally resolve any dispute before initiating arbitration.
A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send the other a written notice that describes the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and sets forth the relief sought.
If you and Valve do not reach an agreement to resolve that claim or dispute within 30 days after the notice is received, you or Valve may commence an arbitration.

"
909,Cookies are required.,"
        Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you browse and use websites and online services.
They are widely used to make websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information and assist with service or advertising personalization.
Cookies are not the only types of technology that enable this functionality.
we also use other, similar types of technologies.
See below for more information and examples.


What are advertising identifiers?
Advertising identifiers are similar to cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the ""Identifier for Advertisers"" (or IDFA) on Apple iOS devices and the ""Google Advertising ID"" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices.
Like cookies, advertising identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant.


Why does Netflix use cookies and advertising identifiers?


Essential cookies: These cookies are strictly necessary to provide our website or online service.
For example, we and our Service Providers may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our websites and applications so we can provide our service to them.
They also help us to enforce our , prevent fraud and maintain the security of our service.

Performance and functionality cookies: These cookies are not essential, but help us to personalize and enhance your online experience with Netflix.
For example, they help us to remember your preferences and prevent you from needing to re-enter information you previously provided (for example, during member sign up).
We also use these cookies to collect information (such as popular pages, conversion rates, viewing patterns, click-through and other information) about our visitors' use of the Netflix service so that we can enhance and personalize our website and service and conduct market research.
Deletion of these types of cookies may result in limited functionality of our service.

Advertising cookies and advertising identifiers: These cookies and advertising identifiers use information about your use of this and other websites and apps, your response to ads and emails, and to deliver ads that are more relevant to you.
These types of ads are called ""interest-based advertising."" Many of the advertising cookies associated with our service belong to our Service Providers.



How can I exercise choice regarding cookies and advertising identifiers?
For more information about cookies set through our website, as well as other types of online tracking (including the collection of information by third parties about your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites or online services for online interest based advertising), and to exercise choices regarding them, click here.
To opt out of interest-based ads from Netflix in connection with an advertising identifier on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media devices, please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under ""privacy"" or ""ads"" in your device's settings).
You may still see Netflix ads on your device, but they will not be tailored to your likely interests.
Netflix supports the following self-regulatory programs, which provide additional privacy choices for interest-based advertising:

In the US: Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)
In Europe: European Interactive Digital Advertising Alliance (EDAA)
In Canada: Ad Choices: Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada (DAAC) / Choix de Pub: l'Alliance de la publicité numérique du Canada (DAAC)

At this time, we do not respond to Web browser ""do not track"" signals.


How Does Netflix use Web Beacons and other Technologies?
Web beacons (also known as clear gifs or pixel tags) often work in conjunction with cookies.
We and our Service Providers may use them for similar purposes as cookies, such as to understand and enhance the use of our service, improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and understand interactions with our marketing (including email and online ads on third party sites).
Because web beacons often work in conjunction with cookies, in many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of web beacons associated with those cookies.
We use other technologies that are similar to cookies, such as browser storage and plugins (e.g., HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL).
Like cookies, some of these technologies may store small amounts of data on your device.
We may use these and various other technologies for similar purposes as cookies, such as to enforce our terms, prevent fraud, and analyze the use of our service.
There are a number of ways to exercise choice regarding these technologies.
For example, many popular browsers provide the ability to clear browser storage, commonly in the settings or preferences area.
see your browser's help function or support area to learn more.
Other technologies, such as Silverlight storage, may be cleared from within the application.

1007,The service may sell your data unless you opt out,"
        
The CCPA requires businesses that “sell” personal information, as the term “sell” is defined under the CCPA, to provide an opt-out from such “sales.” Some people have taken the position that when a website or app uses third-party cookies and similar technology for its own analytics or advertising purposes, the website/app is engaged in a “sale” under the CCPA if the third parties have some ability to use, disclose or retain the data to improve their service or to take steps beyond the most narrowly drawn bounds of merely providing their service to the website/app.
Some take this position even when the website/app pays the third party (not vice versa), and in most cases merely provides the third party with an opportunity to collect data directly, instead of sending a copy of personal information to the third party.
If you take the position that any of those relationships involve a “sale” within the meaning of the CCPA, then you may consider Flickr to have “sold” what the CCPA calls “identifiers” (like IP addresses), “internet or other electronic network activity information” (like information regarding an individual’s browsing interactions on Flickr.com), and “commercial information” (like the fact that a browser visited a particular page on our website) to those sorts of companies.

As also explicitly stated in the , we are obliged to provide access to Lawful Interception requests issued by a Swiss judge.

As a country that places a high value on privacy, Switzerland is extremely reluctant with such access, and all the statistics of such Lawful Interceptions (LI) are always provided in anonymized form by the authorities themselves, including detailed spreadsheets that allow you to control the grounds for approval.
As you can see for yourself in the detailed overview for 2014 (and the one for 2012, 2013), there were only 12 (20 in 2012, 31 in 2013) cases of real-time internet wire-tapping in all of Switzerland and a further 18 (26 in 2012, 32 in 2013) for retroactive communication meta-information.
Although that information is not provided, to our knowledge none of these was for email, specifically.
We do however know that this information is complete.
For more information, please see our overview on the Swiss legal framework.
What we do know is that Kolab Systems has received a total of

0 requests to access customer data
0 such requests were granted, and
0 such requests were denied
and we have received

1 administrative request and 2 unauthorized attempts for administrative requests.
Please see the complete statistics for more information.

Deletion: You have the right to request that we delete certain personal information we have collected from you.

Opt-Out of Sale: You have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information.


How to Submit a Request. To submit an access or deletion request, please log into your Foursquare account or call us at (855)-505-8916.
To opt-out of the sale of your personal information, click here or email us at privacy@foursquare.com.

If you do not know your device identifier, below are instructions on how to locate it.
We will not use the information you provide as part of your request for any purpose other than to fulfill your opt-out request.

If you use an iOS operating system, a third-party application is required to locate your Apple IDFA.
